# Stock Price Prediction Project

This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to predict stock prices. It utilizes historical stock data and deep learning techniques to make predictions. The project is implemented in Python and uses libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Features
- LSTM-based stock price prediction model
- Data preprocessing with Pandas
- Visualization of predictions using Matplotlib
